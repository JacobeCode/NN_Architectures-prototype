# NN_Architectures

## This repository contains some projects conected to testing and preparing NN architectures with PyTorch.
### Here you can find:
- sentiment analysis (NN for sentiment analysis in text opinions) [in progress]
- digit recognition (CNN for digit recognition in spoken records) [prototype]
- Cpp_Build - some small files for C++ build

## Requirements:
### All libs and packages listed in requirements.txt.
### Optionaly - for GPU support all CUDA related and neccesary files (you can find them here [CUDA Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html))

## Used databases:
### Sentiment Analysis - [Emotions dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp/data)

### Digit Recognition - [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST)
